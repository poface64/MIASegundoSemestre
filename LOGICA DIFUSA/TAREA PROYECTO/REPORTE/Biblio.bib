	abstract = {Distance metric learning is a fundamental problem in data mining and knowledge discovery. Many representative data mining algorithms, such as k-nearest neighbor classiﬁer, hierarchical clustering and spectral clustering, heavily rely on the underlying distance metric for correctly measuring relations among input data. In recent years, many studies have demonstrated, either theoretically or empirically, that learning a good distance metric can greatly improve the performance of classiﬁcation, clustering and retrieval tasks. In this survey, we overview existing distance metric learning approaches according to a common framework. Speciﬁcally, depending on the available supervision information during the distance metric learning process, we categorize each distance metric learning algorithm as supervised, unsupervised or semi-supervised. We compare those different types of metric learning methods, point out their strength and limitations. Finally, we summarize open challenges in distance metric learning and propose future directions for distance metric learning.},

It uses signals collected from brain to communicate, control or instruct computer or electronic devices. Analyzing the signals collected is most important task. If the collected data contains overlapping classes, directly applying classification techniques is inefficient.},

In the model, it is assumed that the membership of each entity to a cluster expresses a part of the cluster prototype reflected in the entity.},
